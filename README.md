# Rainfall-Prediction
This repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of rainfall prediction using linear regression. Leveraging historical rainfall data and relevant environmental factors as predictors, the model employs the principles of linear regression to forecast future precipitation levels.
<p> Rainfall Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python script for rainfall prediction using linear regression, accompanied by a dataset and visualization code. The project aims to forecast precipitation levels based on historical weather data and relevant environmental factors.

Getting Started

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is "austin_weather.csv", containing historical weather data for Austin, Texas. It includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, and precipitation.
Dependencies:

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
numpy,
pandas,
sklearn (scikit-learn),
matplotlib

The script performs the following steps:
Preprocesses the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Trains a linear regression model to predict precipitation levels based on other meteorological parameters.
Generates visualizations depicting the precipitation trend and its correlation with various attributes.
Thank you for using Rainfall Prediction Using Linear Regression! We hope you find it useful for your weather forecasting tasks.</p>
